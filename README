This is designed to help config the dev env for the following: 
  vim (neovim)
  bash
  readline

It also provides some general guidance for setting up fresh machines 


The following files need to be symlinked:
  .bashrc
  .inputrc
  .vimrc (or specific variant)

This can be achieved in linux by running the following 
  ln -s ~/devenv/vimrc ~/.vimrc
  ln -s ~/devenv/vimrc ~/.config/nvim/init.vim (for neovim
  ln -s ~/devenv/inputrc ~/.inputrc
  ln -s ~/devenv/bashrc ~/.bashrc 


Additionally, another file (nt.sh), not tracked on git will need to be manually transfered and put in the home dir

Vim also relies on there being an environment variable that points to the symlink for .vimrc

For vim Plugin support, plugged also needs to be installed: https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug
* For neovim in linux:
    curl -fLo ~/.local/share/nvim/site/autoload/plug.vim --create-dirs \
